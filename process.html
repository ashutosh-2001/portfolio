                    <br>
                    <p>My strategy involves using the website as a way of communication to deliver a message to customers. I combine all aspects of branding, design, and marketing strategy to create a clear vision of the website and understand my target
                        audience. I focus on usability and readability more than the style unless it's specifically oriented for content involving graphic design. I determine the brand image as having a purpose, with the design colours, keywords, and
                        design of it. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I produce content based on personas, and wireframing according to my vision of the website and design it in a way that maximizes accessibility and usability. I follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and focus on data
                        analytics with SEO by using segmentation and improving the conversion rate with increased interaction from users.

        <div class="bgimg-2 ">
            <div class="parallax-caption ">
                <span class="parallax-border " style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.767); "><a href="#section-seo-strategy ">Macro/micro conversion</a></span>

        <div class="parallax-content p-5 bg-black text-white container-fluid " style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.473);">
            <div>
                <p>One of my macro conversion goals is the amount of <b>e-commerce order completions</b>. It'd help in demonstrating how effectiveness of the marketing campaign based on the conversion rate. If the conversion rate is low which includes high
                    visitors but low purchases then that means a successful ad campaign needs to be in place that focuses on the users interest, the content they watch, and search terms. The rate of this will help me evaluate if a business is successful
                    depending on the total purchasers, or first time purchasers. </p>
                <p><b>Social actions</b> such as the amount of shares is another one of my conversion goals involving the reviews, shares, and watching a video. I can use these as a conversion rate because they are a fundamental part of the website as it
                    helps in expanding the reach of the audience and allows you to see if it's effectively engaging with your audience. </p>
                <p><b>Creating an account</b> is another conversion goal that can be used to track how many new customers are joining the site and measure the success of the strategies deployed to gain new potential customers. It also provides valuable data
                    about customers and enhances their shopping experience.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="parallax-content p-5 bg-black text-white container-fluid " style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.473);">
            <div>
                <h4 style="text-align: center;">3 unique segmentations</h4>
                <br>
                <p>The first segmentation is the device type, device targeting helps in the most efficent and responsive website for the device source with the greatest amount of users. It helps focus more on fixing the technical issues for that source</p>
                <p>The second segmentation is word search, it helps narrowing down the audience's interests and their motivation of what they care about. It also helps in identifying the topics and themes that interests the audience.</p>
                <p>The last segment is the geographic location, it helps in creating content that is marketed for different groups. This can be also be used for displaying shipping information for more interaction. </p>
            </div>
        </div>


        <div class="bgimg-3 ">
            <div class="parallax-caption ">
                <span class="parallax-border " style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.767); "><a href="#section-seo-strategy ">SEO/SEM and keyword plan</a></span>
            </div>
        </div>


        <div class="parallax-content p-5 bg-black text-white container-fluid " style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.473);">
            <div>
                <h4 style="text-align: center;">Based on my conversion goals and segmentations</h4>
                <br>
                <p>I'd target the audience with keywords that interest them and I'll compare their interests to my website. If their interests demonstrate that they can be a potential customer for the website then I'd add the keywords based on the compatibility
                    between their interests and the content on the website. I'd think about the related words to certain topics, for example, "my cat has food allergies". I'd add keywords such as "natural ingredients" for a website related to cat food.
                    I'd prevent repeating keywords in my content over and over again so it doesn't affect the search engine negatively since the bots can catch that.
                    <br>
                    <p>I'd use keywords in the website page URL, for example, an e-commerce website with different categories of products should have a URL with keywords that identify a certain category. Having mobile optimization is another SEO plan that
                        can help in crawling because the search engines priortize mobile version for indexing and ranking. I'd use internal linking and alt tags stay on the website longer to share content. The alt tags would help the search engine in
                        crawling especially if the images have an alt-text for describing the content.</p>
